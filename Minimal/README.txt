Minimal programs are all console programs that are meant for the use in case of an emergency backup, meaning they will work with no problem whatsoever.
However, because of the limitations of minimal programs, these are what the minimal programs can do:

- Keyboard hook
- Send minimal data to Arduino

Anything else you can think of that the other console or application programs can do will not be done in the minimal programs.
Due to this, I do have a separate program that will auto repeat the music until closed.
