# The Monster Controller
Every Halloween, my dad and I set up animatronic monsters to scare people when they come toward our house.  Scary, right?

This holds each different softwares to use, scripting and compiling, which communicates with an Arduino, which activates relays controlling where power and audio goes.

## Proposed Languages to use:
- Minimal: Python
- Console: Python, TypeScript (nodejs), Rust, C++ (for windows only),
- Application: Tauri (offline), React

Not planned, but I also might go into C# Blazor for application.
